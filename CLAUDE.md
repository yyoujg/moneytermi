# moneytermi - Project Rules

## Stack
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Supabase (backend/DB)
- Toss Design System (TDS) components

## Code Rules
- Simplest working solution. No over-engineering.
- No abstractions for single-use operations.
- No speculative features or "you might also want..."
- Read the file before modifying it. Never edit blind.
- No docstrings or type annotations on code not being changed.
- No error handling for scenarios that cannot happen.
- Three similar lines is better than a premature abstraction.

## Review / Debug Rules
- State the bug. Show the fix. Stop.
- No suggestions beyond the scope of the request.
- Never speculate about a bug without reading the relevant code first.
- If cause is unclear: say so. Do not guess.

## Scope
- Do not touch code outside the exact request.
- Do not refactor, rename, or reformat surrounding code.
